/// The base class for a 3es message handler.
///
/// @par Thread safety
/// A @c Message handler will typically have functions called from at least two different threads.
/// In particular the @c readMessage() and @c endFrame() functions are called from the data
/// processing thread, while @c prepareFrame() and @c draw() are called from the main thread.
/// Other functions are called from the main thread. As such, the @c readMessage() and @c endFrame()
/// functions must be thread safe with respect to @c prepareFrame() and @c draw().
///
/// Note that the data thread functions and draw functions - @c prepareFrame() and @c draw() - are
/// independent of one another. There are no call order of frequency guarantees relating
/// @c endFrame() to the two draw functions. That is, the data thread may run independently of draw
/// function calls, calling @c readMessage() zero or more times for each call to @c endFrame() .
/// Mean while, the main thread may or may not call @c prepareFrame() and @c draw() at any time
/// in between. However, it is worth noting that a @c prepareFrame() call which is followed by a
/// @c draw() call cannot have @c endFrame() called in between.
///
/// Generally we expect that every @c prepareFrame() call will be followed by @c draw() calls, but
/// not every @c draw() call is preceeded by a @c prepareFrame() call. This is partly because
/// @c draw() is called with multiple @c DrawPass values, but also because @c prepareFrame() is only
/// called when needed, which is whenever @c draw() calls must be made after @c endFrame() has been
/// called. Multiple sets of @c draw() calls may be made without @c prepareFrame() so long as
/// @c endFrame() has not been called. Meanwhile, @c readMessage() may continue to be called in
/// between @c prepareFrame() and @c draw() calls.
///
/// The @c ThirdEyeScene class manages and enforces this call relationship and associated
/// synchronisation and locking.
