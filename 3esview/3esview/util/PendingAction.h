/// changes until the frame completes - until @c handlers::Message::endFrame() is called. The
/// @c PendingAction provides a data structure which can be added to a vector (or queue) to track
/// actions to be effected on the next @c handlers::Message::endFrame() call. We typically expect
/// to only enqueue create, update and destroy actions, as determined by @c ActionKind , as data
/// messages always occur after create, but before the next frame.
///
/// This structure contains data for all three potential message types, with the @c kind member
/// identifying which data section is currently relevant.

/// While this union (mathematical terminology rather than C++ @c union ) of types is somewhat
/// wasteful memory-wise, it is a very simple way to amalgamate the available actions into a single
/// queue.

/// @c shared_ptr to the @c tes::Shape type or value type thereof, depending on class size and
