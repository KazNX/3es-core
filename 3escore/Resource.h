/// The @p Resource base class defines an interface for any resource used by @p Shape
/// objects such as @c MeshSet. Resources are uniquely identified by a combination of
/// their @p typeId() and @p id(). The @p typeId() essentially acts as a class type ID -
/// e.g., mesh or material - while the @p id() is unique amongst objects of that type.
///
/// The IDs are most significantly used in reference counting resource usage and to
/// identify which resources require transfer to each client. A @c Resource is transferred
/// to a client when first referenced and a destroy message sent when the last shape
/// using that resource is destroyed.
///
/// The transfer of a @c Resource to a client follows this lifecycle:
/// -# Generate and send a creation message by calling @c create().
/// -# Call @c transfer() and send each packet until the @p TransferProgress is
///     complete or fails.
/// -# Call @c destroy() after the last shape referencing the @c Resource is destroyed.
///
/// These steps are followed for each connected client all these functions must be
/// reentrant.
