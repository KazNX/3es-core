@page docplugins Message Handler Plugins
The 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene protocol is extensible and allows for user defined messages. Writing 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye
Scene handles for user messages requires authoring of a viewer plugin. Viewer plugins are .Net DLLs which include
derivations of the @c Tes.Runtime.MessageHandler for dealing with user messages.

Most <tt>@ref Tes.Runtime.MessageHandler "MessageHandler"</tt> implementations deal with 3D objects; primitives, meshes
and text. However, some message handlers deal with other types of data. The <tt>@ref Tes.Handlers.CategoriesHandler
"CategoriesHandler"</tt> for example, manages the names of and links between categories and has 3D representation. User
messages may follow either pattern, depending on the need.

For example, in games, user messages may be used to visualise an agent's game attributes in a single message. Health,
primary AI state, ammunition, etc. may be collated into a much smaller single message as opposed to using  multiple text
messages.

@section secauthoring Authoring a 3rd Eye Scene Plugin
To author a 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene plugin;
-# Define the messages for the user entities (generally shapes)
-# Create a .Net project file which references:
  - 3esCore library
  - 3esRuntime library
  - UnityEngine library*
-# Implement the client messages in C# and equivalent server messages in C++
-# Create a handler class deriving @c Tes.Runtime.MessageHandler
-# Implement the abstract methods to:
  - Define a Unity @c GameObject to act as a root for all objects created by this handler.
  - In @c MessageHandler.Initialise() add the handler's root @c GameObject either to:
    - the scene @c root if the handler's object transformation coordinates are in the server's coordinate frame, or
    - to the @c serverRoot if the handler's object transformation coordinates are in Unity's coordinate frame
  - Handle the new messages, creating Unity objects as required
  - Discriminate transient and persistent objects based on the object ID
  - Serialise shapes on request
-# Build the plugin DLL
-# Copy the DLL to the viewer's plugin directory (create this directory alongside the executable).
  - Note: plugins are also searched for in 3rd-Eye-Scene_Data/Managed

* See @ref subreferenceunityengine for guidelines on referencing UnityEngine.dll

@subsection subreferenceunityengine Referencing Unity Engine
The 3esRuntime library serves an example of how to reference the UnityEngine dll in a cross platform way. This relies on
a few assumptions:
- Using conditional blocks in the MSBuild project file (3esRuntime.csproj)
- Using the @c UNITY_DLL_PATH environment variable to locate the DLL when possible
- Falling back to finding UnityEngine.dll in a known, platform specific location

A discussion of MSBuild files is beyond the scope of this documentation, other than to note that both Visual Studio and
Xamarin Studio use MSBuild files to control compilation and both support conditional blocks.

Essentially, 3esRuntime.csproj references UnityEngine.DLL via the XML code below. The same code can be used to reference
the DLL in other .Net project files. Be aware that this code must be manually edited into the project file as Visual
Studio and Xamarin Studio do not support creating conditional statements via the UI, but do respect them on reading such
project files.

@code{.xml}
  <ItemGroup>
    <Reference Include="UnityEngine" Condition="!Exists('$(UNITY_DLL_PATH)') And
Exists('\\Applications\\Unity\\Unity.app\\Contents\\Managed\\UnityEngine.dll') ">
      <HintPath>\Applications\Unity\Unity.app\Contents\Managed\UnityEngine.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>False</Private>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="UnityEngine" Condition="!Exists('$(UNITY_DLL_PATH)') And Exists('C:\\Program
Files\\Unity\\Editor\\Data\\Managed\\UnityEngine.dll') "> <HintPath>C:\Program
Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\UnityEngine.dll</HintPath> <Private>False</Private>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="UnityEngine" Condition=" Exists('$(UNITY_DLL_PATH)') ">
      <HintPath>$(UNITY_DLL_PATH)\UnityEngine.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>False</Private>
    </Reference>
  </ItemGroup>
@endcode

@section sectest Testing a 3rd Eye Scene Plugin
The build guidelines above illustrate how to integrate a user plugin into a pre-built version of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye
Scene viewer. To facilitate debugging and testing, it is recommended that user plugin DLLs are added to the
3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene viewer Unity project instead. Build the DLL as described above, then copy the DLL into the
viewer Assets folder under: <tt>Assets/plugins</tt>. Unity will automatically include this DLL while running under in
the Unity editor and on building the project.

@subsection Custom 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene Viewer Builds
There is an alternative way to author custom <tt>@ref Tes.Runtime.MessageHandler "MessageHandler"</tt> implementations.
In this option, the custom handlers are packaged as part of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene viewer as a customised viewer
build. This may be more convenient when distribution is tightly controlled and provides an simpler workflow.
-# Define the messages for the user entities (generally shapes)
-# Open the 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene viewer Unity project.
-# Define client messages and associated <tt>@ref Tes.Runtime.MessageHandler "MessageHandler"</tt> objects within this
project.
-# Implement the client messages in C# and equivalent server messages in C++
-# Build the viewer with user extensions built-in.

It is recommended that the viewer executable name is changed in these circumstances, to reflect the custom build to
avoid confusion with the default 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene viewer application.

@section secexample Example Plugin
An example plugin project and program are provided as part of the C# core libraries. To see the plugin in in effect:
-# Build the 3esCore C# project.
-# Build the 3<sup>rd</sup> Eye Scene viewer application.
-# Find 3esExamplePlugin.dll under 3esExamplePlugin/bin/Release
-# Copy 3esExamplePlugin.dll into the viewer plugins directory.
  - You will have to create this directory alongside the exectuable.
-# Run 3esPluginTest.exe
-# Run the viewer and connect to the loopback address on the default port.
You should see a white pyramid alongside the axis arrows.
