/// A utility class which generates a @c MtCollatedPacket message by appending multiple
/// other messages. Compression may optionally be applied.
///
/// Typical usage:
/// - Instantiate the packet.
/// - Reset the packet.
/// - For each constituent message
///   - Generate the packet using @p PacketWriter.
///   - Finalise the message.
///   - Call @c add(const PacketWriter &)
/// - Call @c finalise() on the collated packet.
/// - Send the collated packet.
/// - Call @c reset()
///
/// The @c CollatedPacket also extends the @c Connection class in order to support
/// multi-threaded packet generation and synchronisation. While the @c Connection
/// and @c Connection implementations are required to be thread-safe, they
/// cannot guarantee packets area correctly collated by thread. Thus a
/// @c CollatedPacket can be used per thread to collate messages for each thread.
/// The packet content can then be sent as a single transaction.
///
/// By supporting the @c Connection methods, a @p CollatedPacket can be used in place
/// of a 'server' argument with various server utility macros and functions.
///
/// By default, a @c CollatedPacket has is limited to supporting @c MaxPacketSize bytes.
/// This allows a single packet with a single @c PacketHeader and collated packet
/// message with optional compression. However, when a collated packet is used for
/// transaction collation (as described in the multi-threaded case), it may require
/// collation of larger data sizes. In this case, the `CollatedPacket(unsigned, unsigned)`
/// constructor can be used to specify a larger collation buffer limit (the buffer resizes as
/// required). Such large, collated packets are sent using `Server::send(const CollatedPacket &)`.
/// Internally, the method may either send the packet as is (if small enough), or extract and
/// reprocess each collated packet.
///
/// @see See @c PacketHeader notes on @c payload_size limits.
