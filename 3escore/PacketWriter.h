/// ensures the CRC is calculated, either via @c calculateCrc() explicitly
/// on on destruction.
///
/// The payload buffer size must be specified in the constructor, and data writes
/// are limited by this value. The packet is assumed to be structured such that
/// the packet header is located at the start of the buffer, followed immediately by
/// space for the payload.
///
/// Two construction options are available, one where the @c PacketHeader details are already
/// initialised, except for the @c payloadSize and @c crc. The given packet is
/// assumed to be the start of the data buffer. The second constructor accepts a raw
/// byte pointer, which marks the start of the buffer, and the size of the buffer.
/// The buffer size must be large enough for the @ PacketHeader. Remaining space is available
/// for the payload.
///
/// @bug Use the payloadOffset in various calculations herein. It was added after this
/// class was written, but is currently only supported as being zero, so it's not an issue
/// yet.
