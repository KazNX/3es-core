/// initialised, except for the @c payloadSize and @c crc. The given packet is
/// assumed to be the start of the data buffer. The second constructor accepts a raw
/// byte pointer, which marks the start of the buffer, and the size of the buffer.
/// The buffer size must be large enough for the @ PacketHeader. Remaining space is available
/// for the payload.
